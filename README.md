# About
A simple equation writer made with Swift.
# Workflow
- New features are implemented on a branch with name `feature/the-feature-name`
# Getting started (dev) ⌨️
1. Run `dev/get-started.sh`
This will set you up with some pre-commit hooks, and the basic installation required to run them.

## On the pre-commit hooks
Using pre-commit hooks, we can make last-minute adjustments to the code base right before we commit, or prevent ourselves from committing given certain conditions, i.e. if the build fails or if testing fails, don't allow commits. If you're not into this, feel free to either not run the `dev/get-started.sh` script, or just run the `dev/disable-hooks.sh` script to opt out of pre-commit hooks.
